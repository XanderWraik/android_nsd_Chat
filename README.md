# android_nsd_chat
A small android app that uses android NSD to discover services and allows for unidirectional multidevice communication.
The execution model assumes only communication from client to server to maintain simplicity of design.

Further, the upload assumes Android Studio as the IDE used. However, it should work well with Eclise also.
The files provided compile directly when opened with Android Studio. 

A working sample can be downloaded off from the _APK folder.
